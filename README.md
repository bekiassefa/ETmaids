Introduction
In today’s fast-paced world, finding the right home maid can be a daunting task. Whether you’re an employer looking for domestic help or a home maid seeking employment, the process can be challenging. That’s where our web application, etmaids, comes into play. We have developed etmaids to simplify the process of connecting home maids with employers, with the assistance of an agent who facilitates the entire journey. Our platform is designed to be trustworthy and user-friendly, providing employers with the ability to choose maids based on various criteria such as match, work experience, religion, and even working conditions. Our team consists of three dedicated members: Bereket Haile, responsible for front-end development and UI/UX design; Melaku Eshetu, handling back-end development using Python, Flask, and MySQL; and Hiwot Zeleke, conducting research, need assessment, and database management.

Who is etmaids for?
Etmaids was created with a specific focus on the Ethiopian population. In Ethiopia, households often face significant challenges when searching for reliable home maids. We recognized this issue and set out to provide a solution. Our platform is tailored to the needs of Ethiopian employers and maids, making it easier for both parties to find suitable employment or hire domestic help.

My Personal Journey
As someone with a background in architecture rather than IT or software engineering, you might wonder what drew me into this project. Well, it all started with my deep appreciation for the value of effective transportation. Growing up in a small town surrounded by farms and forests, I relied on my bicycle to visit my best friend in the neighboring town. Those early morning rides with the sunrise on one side and the scent of harvest in the air left a lasting impression on me. Bicycling became more than just a mode of transport; it became a symbol of freedom and exploration. When I joined the etmaids project, I saw an opportunity to use technology to make a real difference in people’s lives, much like how my bicycle made a difference in mine.

Accomplishments
Our team has achieved significant milestones with etmaids. We’ve created a user-friendly platform that connects employers and maids seamlessly. Here’s a brief overview of our accomplishments:

Tackling the Toughest Challenge
One of the most challenging technical issues we faced during the development of etmaids was ensuring that our Flask application displayed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript correctly. Initially, we encountered a problem where only HTML was rendered, and CSS and JavaScript seemed to be ignored. Here’s how we tackled this challenge using the STAR method:

Situation: We noticed that our web application’s appearance and functionality were not as expected due to issues with rendering CSS and JavaScript.

Task: Our task was to diagnose the problem and implement a solution to ensure that the application displayed correctly.

Action: We conducted extensive research, seeking guidance from online resources, peers, and forums. We realized that the issue was related to the way Flask handled static files. We configured Flask to serve static files correctly, ensuring that both CSS and JavaScript were loaded and applied.

Result: With our action plan in place, we successfully resolved the issue. Etmaids now displays HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as intended, providing users with a seamless experience.

Lessons Learned
Working on etmaids has been a valuable learning experience. Here are some takeaways:

Technical Skills: I gained proficiency in front-end development, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Problem-Solving: I learned that tackling technical challenges requires patience, research, and a collaborative spirit.
Interdisciplinary Approach: My background in architecture proved to be an asset, as it brought a unique perspective to the project.
The Power of Technology: I witnessed how technology can address real-world problems and bring about positive change.
